### Practical Examples

**Scenario 1: Real-time Interaction Support**
Parent: "My child keeps repeating lines from their favorite show instead of responding to my questions."

AI Coach Response: 
1. Immediate validation: "This is a common form of gestalt language processing. Your child is using familiar scripts to communicate."
2. Context gathering: "When does this happen most often? What shows are they quoting from?"
3. Practical guidance: "Let's try working with these scripts rather than discouraging them. Here's how..."
4. Specific example: "If they quote 'To infinity and beyond!', you might say 'Yes! You want to go... [pause]' to encourage script expansion."
5. Follow-up: Offers to record the interaction for analysis or connect with similar experiences from other parents
