## Development Tips

1. **Component Development**:
   - Start with mobile design first
   - Use TypeScript for all components
   - Implement error boundaries
   - Add loading states

2. **Firebase Integration**:
   - Use typed collections
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add offline support
   - Optimize queries

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement proper code splitting
   - Use React.memo where appropriate
   - Optimize Firebase reads/writes
   - Add proper caching
